#The classes outlines are started but need work.

# Introduction #

I followed the UML diagrams we have been putting together and started making the classes. Syntatically they could use some work and lots more comments. I only put an hour or so into them but I'm skiing all weekend and I can finish up anything left on Monday before uploading milestone 1 Monday evening.


# Details #
This should help get some of the things the classes outlines are missing off the top of my head.
A quick to do list:
  * UML and classes need to be finished
  * Linking the various classes needs to be fixed
  * Characters should be an abstract class
  * Missing several methods in all classes
  * User input classes not started yet
