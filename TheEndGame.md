# Introduction #

The final strech is here and this is a list of what need to be done. Update the list if your taking on something or have finished something.


# Details #

fix ghost tests... done
  * implement scared and power pellets... Nicole assigned
  * implement lives for pac man
  * implement map editor ... Nahim assigned
  * implement validateLevel and validateMap for the map editor Jef may work on this but I think Nahim will have some ideas as to how he expects it to run.
  * finish XML importing.. jef's almost done
  * XML exporting.. done
  * make file completed.. done except for running the JUnit tests (Jef and Nicole don't know how to).. I've sent an email to Michale asking for a code snipit on what the build .xml should look like for this.
  * compile at least a 3 map game.

side notes the things that always have to be done:

  * update uml/sequence/readme/user manual
  * Unit testing

That should be all pretty easy hopefully we don't get hung up on anything.
Final note Jef is doing the submit this time and I will make sure that all the items are submitted.
