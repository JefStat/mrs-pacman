Other mid-terms and assignments.

# Details #

Hey guys,

I know that everyone is busy with mid-terms and assignments (myself included).  I will be meeting with Jen in 508 AA Thrusday night probably for only an hour or so.  If will be there Saturday after mid-term (12 pm onward) and Sunday (10 am onward) to continue working on the second milestone.

If anyone wants to join me they are more than welcome too.

Thanks!
