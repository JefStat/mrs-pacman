Currently working on completing MapEditor implementation.
NOTE- need a way to disable the players movement while the editor is open (Jeff)

Also, as soon as importXML and exportXML are complete and working, i will implement them into the gui (Jeff)

Going to code the validate functions in the map class concurrently with the mapediting



powerpellets have been implemented in the gui today, the behaviour needs to be coded(nicole)  --- following a similar pattern as to how pacdots disappear
